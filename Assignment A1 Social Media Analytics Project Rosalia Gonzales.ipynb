Please behave in accordance with the following rules.\\n\\n 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.\\n\\n 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.\\n\\n 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence. For example, announcing an obscure online store is adopting coin X for payments and then speculate Amazon will adopt it next without evidence. Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. \\n\\n 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying “Buy coin X!” or “Coin X is going to the moon!🚀”, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. \\n\\n 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.\\n\\nMost of the above rules will be promptly enforced upon top-level comments by AutoModerator. Please report shilling or any comments which violate the rules.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n###Resources and Tools:\\n\\n * Read through the [Cointest Archive](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/cointest_archive) to find positive material to discuss and consider participating in the contest if you're interested.\\n\\n * Click the RES subscribe button below if you want to be notified when new comments are posted.        \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n***\\n\\n**For help finding prior Optimists Discussion threads, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=title%3A%22Optimists+Discussion+-+%22+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).**\\n\\n**For help finding the latest Skeptics Discussion thread, [click here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/search?q=title%3A%22Skeptics+Discussion+-+%22+&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).**\",\n",

       "  'I have a comment on the cons for Polkadot, many statements which are just factually incorrect or incomplete, by roberthonker:\\n\\n```\\nIf you want to contribute to consensus with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, all you need is a powerful computer and a connection to the internet. There is also no limit to how many block proposers can join these networks: the more, the better because it improves security. These things are not true for Polkadot. At the time of writing, DOT only allows 297 validators. This is obviously bad for decentralization because not everyone has the ability to propose blocks.  \\n\\nPolkadot currently has 13 \"council\" members. These members are elected through users voting with their DOT. As of writing this comment, to become a Polkadot council member, you would need a minimum of 11 million DOT to back you. At $28/DOT, that\\'s $300 million. Unless you are a popular celebrity or you are super-rich, there’s no way you can become a council member. It’s a elite group that controls Polkadot, and you will never be able to be a part of the important decisions. Polkadot’s governance is skewed to the rich and famous. This makes things ridiculously centralized.  \\n\\nTo conclude I ask: What is the point of a centralized smart contract platform?  \\n\\nThe answer to this is that there is no point. Without decentralization, you might as well be using a normal database. At the moment PolkaDot is not adequately decentralized to be called a smart contract platform (in my opinion)  \\n```\\n\\n## Incorrect or incomplete claims:\\n\\n### \"DOT only allows 297 validators; this is obviously bad for decentralization\"\\n\\nDOT uses [NPoS](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking) which imo is *at least* as decentralized as Ethereum-PoS, since the minimum staking amount is much lower (100 DOTish vs 32 ETH). Stakers delegate their tokens to a validator *they trust* and get returns for staking their tokens *only* if that validator is part of the next validating set. If the validators they voted for are in the top 297 validators by total tokens delegated to them, they become part of the set.\\n\\nIf that validator misbehaves, everyone who delegated to that validator gets their tokens slashed, too. The validator\\'s reputation is ruined. You wouldn\\'t delegate your tokens to any random validator, would you? To nominate a set of malicious validators (to double spend), it would require controll of an *extremely* large number of tokens (almost half the total staked tokens on the network), and most tokens would be burned as a result of the attack anyway.\\n\\n### \"What is the point of a centralized smart contract platform?\"\\n\\n1. Polkadot is not centralized. It uses NPoS so it can have a smaller validator set. See above.\\n2. Polkadot is not a smart contract platform. It only provides two features: interoperability and shared security. Interoperability between it\\'s parachains (*para*llel block*chains*) allows for cross-chain smart contract execution, token bridging, etc, and  shared security means every parachain takes advantage of Polkadot\\'s NPoS validator set as it\\'s own (doesn\\'t need to run validators, no economic security to worry about).\\n\\n### Polkadot\\'s council is an \"elite group that controls Polkadot ... It makes things ridiculously centralized.\"\\n\\nWhile the council\\'s vote holds power, [it can always be overridden by the majority token holders](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance). Tokens also get locked for a period of time when voting, discouraging whales from a \"buy-vote-sell\" mentality.\\n\\n## Real Con\\'s of Polkadot\\n\\n### Parachain slots are limited and not free (unlike Cosmos/ATOM)\\n\\nParachain slots are limited in number, auctioned to the highest bidder, and *leased* (2 years). You alone won\\'t have enough DOT tokens to win a slot, so you need to convince the Polkadot community that your project will bring enough value to the community that the tokens you give them in-exchange for helping you lease the slot will be worth something.',\n",

       "  \"Worst consequences of quantum computers is pretty much just being able to send tokens from an account you don't own. While this is a major problem, you couldn't rewrite the chain's history, mint new tokens, hide your traces, etc.\\n\\nThat said, famous cryptographer Bruce Schnier, as of 2022, thinks [quantum computers aren't even remotely close to being able to break these algorithms](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/02/breaking-245-bit-elliptic-curve-encryption-with-a-quantum-computer.html).\\n\\nEven with large quantum computers in the hands of a malicious party, lots of UTXO based protocols (like BTC) are already **extremely** quantum-resistant. By using quantum-safe hash functions, quantum computers would need to be able to break an arbitrary key within 10 minutes (BTC block time).\\n\\nWhile most cryptocurrencies are build on quantum-unsafe signature algorithms (like ECDSA), as long as they upgrade to a quantum-safe algorithm and you move your tokens to a new wallet before, they're pretty much unaffected.\",\n",

       "  'I agree. The space had a lot of negative things happen in a short amount of time, but it’s resiliency is starting to show',\n",

So what happens if miners are not able to find the hash in 10 mins to add the block to the chain?',\n",
       "  \"Don't forget the unraveling of Celsius (in full disclosure: I get it as to why Celsius customers are feeling pain to this day, and hope all is well in this regard). \\n\\nWith that said, I believe that regulation of some kind will hopefully enforce levels of transparency onto any crypto platform one chooses with to park their assets. This not only ensures accountability on the part of the industry but also some legitimacy in the eyes of institutional clients as well. Cryptocurrency needs maturity. It's no wonder why the SEC is stonewalling every Bitcoin spot ETF application this year.\",\n",
